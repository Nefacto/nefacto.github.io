        <img src = "caracteristiques-pysiques-berger-allemand.jpg">
        <p2><br>The methodical breeding began in 1889. This breed was created by Captain Max Fr√©deric Emile Von Stephanitz from the crossing of shepherd dogs from central and southern Germany. The goal was to create a useful dog, very intelligent and strong physically for the keeping of herds.<br>
          It was not until the end of the 19th century and the industrial revolution in Germany that the first German Shepherds were brought up. Then, Captain Von Stephanitz defines race. A German Shepherd is essentially a working dog. Dog says versatile, the German Shepherd is useful in many areas. During the First World War, he accompanied the German army, in particular to rescue the wounded soldiers.<br>
          As the flocks disappeared, the evolution of the breed pushed the man to use the faculties of the German Shepherd to make him a police, war, blind dog or sanitary dog.</p2>
